`xxallanxx/laravel-menus` is a laravel package which created to manage menus. It has a feature called presenters which enables easy styling and custom structure of menu rendering.

This package is a re-published, re-organised and maintained version of [pingpong/menus](https://github.com/pingpong-labs/menus), which isn't maintained anymore. This package is used in [AsgardCMS](https://asgardcms.com/).

With one big added bonus that the original package didn't have: **tests**.
